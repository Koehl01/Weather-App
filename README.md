## Summarize the project and what problem it will solve.
The main goal of this project will be to allow users to view local news and weather.

## Project Details
When the user first accesses the website, their IP address is used as the search parameter for a weather API request as well as a news API request. The weather API returns the current weather and a 7 day forcast for their location. It also returns a weather code determining the background image of the webpage. Creating an account will add the ability to save multiple locations in a My Locations tab and be stored in a database. The weather and local news sections will update based on the users search. The search itself is using the Google Places API with autocomplete and will replace the IP address as the search parameter for the weather and news requests.

## Currently...
This has been an enjoyable project so far. I Love the idea of a full background image for the weather depiction instead of just a small icon. Im also happy with color scheme of the main title bar and look forward to applying it to the other components. The weather API Im using is weatherstack and is well documented and also has a free limited option.
